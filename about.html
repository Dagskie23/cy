        <H1> HELLO EVERYBODY!</H1>
        <p>Hello! My name is Cy, short for Cyrell, and I'm currently a student at ISPSC pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology. I'm passionate about technology and its endless possibilities. My journey in the field of IT has been both exciting and challenging, but I thrive on learning and exploring new concepts. I believe that technology can transform lives and empower communities, and I'm dedicated to making a positive impact through my studies and future endeavors. When I'm not immersed in the world of code and computers, you can find me exploring the latest innovations, reading tech blogs, or engaging in creative projects. I look forward to the endless opportunities and growth that the world of Information Technology has to offer!
